# godot-ggrs-wrapper

The purpose of this repo is to create a wrapper for the [ggrs](https://github.com/gschup/ggrs) Rust crate so that this can be used inside the Godot Game Engine. To accomplish this i will be using the [godot-rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust) GDNative bindings. This project is a **WIP** and thus shouldn't be treated as a fully working solution yet. I'm also very much a beginner at writing Rust code so not everything might be as efficient as it could be.
